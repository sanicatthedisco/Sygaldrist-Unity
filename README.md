# Sygaldrist
A port of the partially finished Sygaldrist game to Unity.

A WIP game based on sygaldry, a subsystem of magic under the larger sympathy in Patrick Rothfuss's series "The Kingkiller Chronicle".

The player solves puzzles by placing objects and inscribing runes on them. These runes facilitate the conversion of energy into different types, and the control of forces. By combining them, a player can create a rune to convert any type of energy into any other, and link two objects.

And what I'm doing with my time during quarantine.
